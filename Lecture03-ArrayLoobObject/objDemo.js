/* Start 

how can you represent real-world object in code?
they have associated arrtibutes = object PROPERTIES
they have associated actions = object METHODS
they have associated context = "this"
*/

/* First:
Let's define a simple object (with no properties or methods) 
*/
const blank = {};
console.log("Blank type:", typeof blank);
console.log("Blank value",blank);

/* 
    Next:
    let's defien an object with PROPERTIES (attributes)
    Object are just a collection of name-value pairs
    separated by commas
